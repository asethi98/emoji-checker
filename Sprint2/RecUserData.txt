-Determine how to record the user data from the app (Create an Account, Query screens) into JSON by discussing with the back-end team

After speaking w/ Perry from the back-end team, we confirmed that an API has been set up for the app. The API assists in allowing for communication between the different components of the app. In addition, we on the front-end can use the Volley library in Android Studio to send the emoji response to the database using the HTTP post method. In the method, the data can be formatted into JSON by mapping the keys specified in the database API (emoji, time stamp, user) to the corresponding values through a HashMap. Our programmers already implemented the HashMap with keys and values for the Query screen. Connecting to a server is also vital to the process.
