# emoji-checker
This project is a collaborative effort between three teams that implemented a RESTful API with Django, an administration application, 
and a front-end Android application that records and logs students' feelings towards a professor's lecture using emojis. It serves as a data analysis tool for professors to enhance the learning experience of their students and provides them with the ability to schedule and monitor student responses and notify students through an SMS to submit their emojis. 

Adhering to the principles of Agile Development, we developed our project over a course of 5 sprints and the corresponding content is located in each of the folders. This repository shows the content for the front-end development of the Android application that the students would be interacting with to submit their responses to their professors. The final project files are located in the Sprint 5 folder along with the screenrecordings of the Android application.
